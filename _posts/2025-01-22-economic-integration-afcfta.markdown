The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) represents the world's largest free trade area by number of countries. Yet, many remain skeptical about its potential impact. As alumni economists and business leaders, we need to engage constructively with both the opportunities and challenges.

## The Promise

AfCFTA aims to create a single continental market for goods and services, with free movement of business persons and investments. The numbers are compelling:

- **1.3 billion people** across 55 countries
- Combined GDP of **$3.4 trillion**
- Potential to lift **30 million** out of extreme poverty
- Could boost intra-African trade by **52% by 2025**

## Current Reality

Intra-African trade currently represents only **16%** of the continent's total trade—far below intra-regional trade in Europe (67%) and Asia (59%). Why?

### Structural Barriers
- Poor transport infrastructure connecting countries
- Non-tariff barriers remain high despite tariff reductions
- Limited productive capacity in many sectors
- Currency inconvertibility challenges

### Political Challenges
- Protectionist sentiment in key industries
- Revenue concerns for customs-dependent governments
- Implementation varies widely by country
- Limited awareness among SMEs

## Making It Work

Based on successful regional integration elsewhere, several factors are critical:

1. **Infrastructure investment**: Physical connectivity enables trade
2. **Harmonized standards**: Simplify cross-border business
3. **Payment systems**: Facilitate currency exchange
4. **Capacity building**: Help SMEs understand and leverage opportunities

## Role for Alumni

Columbia graduates can contribute meaningfully:

**Research & Analysis**
- Studying implementation challenges
- Evaluating economic impacts
- Identifying best practices

**Business Leadership**
- Establishing pan-African operations
- Mentoring cross-border entrepreneurs
- Creating regional value chains

**Policy Engagement**
- Advising governments on implementation
- Advocating for practical reforms
- Building public-private partnerships

## A Long-Term Project

Economic integration is measured in decades, not years. The EU took 60+ years to reach its current state. AfCFTA will face setbacks, but the direction is clear.

The question isn't whether Africa should integrate economically—it's how quickly and effectively we can make it happen.
